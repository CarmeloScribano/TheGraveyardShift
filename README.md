# Inspiration

As avid gamers, we love playing video games ranging from role playing games, to puzzle solving games, all the way to first-person shooters. 
In the context of our Game Development 2 class we decided that we would want to develop an FPS game around the theme of Zombies. We fully developed the game
from the ground up, including the full design of the UI, enemies, maps, weapons, bosses, and much more. We also implemented the AI around the enemies and many more 
mechanics such as the flashlight, cut screens, etc.



# What it does

The Graveyard Shift is an FPS that takes place in a bearen winter land where your plane has been destroyed by a mysterious entity. You are left alone in a forest
with your flashlight, weapons, and your sense of survival. You must fight through the forest to make your way to the plane crash to save the reste of your platoon.


# How we built it

We build the game using Unity. We also used Blender in order to develop our own assets and to modify pre existing ones.



# Challenges we ran into

It was very hard to have such a large project to work on in a large team of four people. In the past, we had only worked in teams of two at a time. This project
was a great way for us to get used to working in larger teams and better organizing our work and tasks. We ran multiple times in massive Git conflicts and this
taught us a lot on proper version control management.



# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are extremely proud of our final product. Seeing that we designed everything in the game minus a few select assets. We implemented all the physics, the AI, the map design
and many other things that seemed impossible at first but turned out possible after a lot of effort and team work.



# What we learned

We learned that nothing is truly impossible in terms of programming and development. It truly takes a lot of time to do some tasks but with the help of a well rounded
teams and a lot of Youtube tutorials, we learned that every feature is possible to develop.



# Built With

C#, Unity, Blender, Github, and Trello
